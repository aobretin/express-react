# sample-javascript-project-1
Sample JavaScript project for developer candidates

## Overview

This is a fairly simple project designed for a full stack web developer. It
is designed to challenge your front end web development skill set as well as
your ability to code a basic API to power a web application.

## Project Requirements 

You are tasked with building a note taking web application.

A note has the following features:

* A title
* A description (the note content)
* A list of "tags" (string identifiers)

The following application features should be completed:

* A main page showing all saved notes titles
* The list of notes can be filtered by tag
* Each entry in the list is a link to a detailed view of the note
* A note can be deleted
* A note can be edited
* A note can be created

## Further Instructions

* You may write your project in JavaScript or TypeScript
* The front end must be written using ReactJS
* The API must be written using ExpressJS 
* Data must be persisted in MongoDB
* You may use any tools you decide are useful (Webpack, CRA, Docker, etc).
* You may use any open source libraries you deem helpful
* You may use any other resources that would normally be available to you including books and internet resources (StackOverflow, etc.)
* You may use any IDE you are familiar with 
* You may **not** ask other people to help with the implementation, nor copy other implementations from the web. 
* Please add instructions for running your application in the "Running" section below.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Pretend you are writing a production application. Anything you would normally do for a production ready web application should be done here as well. You do not have to host a working copy of the application but it should be easily possible to do so.

* One of the most important criteria for production code is maintainability. Do your best to write the code so that other developers can read and understand it so that they can more easily maintain it. You will be evaluated on code readability, including things like picking good names and logical code organization

* Another important criteria of a production application is proving that it works. How do you prove that your implementation works correctly? 

* You are not being measured on the time it takes you to complete this project, you should have ample time and we do not intend to put you under time pressure 

* As part of your submission, document your design and the edge cases you considered and how you handled them. Put this information in the `design.md` file. 

* Good Luck! If you have any questions, please email Chris at chris.kramp@anonossoftware.com
